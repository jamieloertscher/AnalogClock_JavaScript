Analog Clock

This project is an analog clock created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays hours, minutes, and seconds in real time, and the pointers move smoothly. In the center, there is a small black dot that serves as the middel and anchor point for the pointers. The clock has four main markings 12, 3, 6 and 9 o’clock)and automatically adjusts to different screen sizes.

The movement of the pointers is calculated with JavaScript: hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds are converted into angles so that everything rotates correctly. CSS is used to style the round clock face, the pointers, the markings, and the center point.
